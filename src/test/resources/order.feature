Feature: E-commerce Order Pricing Promotions
  As a shopper
  I want the system to calculate my order total with applicable promotions
  So that I can understand how much to pay and what items I will receive

  Scenario: Single product without promotions
    Given no promotions are applied
    When a customer places an order with:
      | productName | quantity | unitPrice |
      | T-shirt     | 1        | 500       |
    Then the order summary should be:
      | totalAmount |
      | 500         |
    And the customer should receive:
      | productName | quantity |
      | T-shirt     | 1        |

  Scenario: Threshold discount applies when subtotal reaches 1000
    Given the threshold discount promotion is configured:
      | threshold | discount |
      | 1000      | 100      |
    When a customer places an order with:
      | productName | quantity | unitPrice |
      | T-shirt     | 2        | 500       |
      | 褲子          | 1        | 600       |
    Then the order summary should be:
      | originalAmount | discount | totalAmount |
      | 1600           | 100      | 1500        |
    And the customer should receive:
      | productName | quantity |
      | T-shirt     | 2        |
      | 褲子          | 1        |
